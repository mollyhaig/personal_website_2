	<p> Assignment: Share your daily journey from home to school.</p>

	<p> Start from the center (home) and manipulate the discs to create a word-association route to the BU design studios at 808. Comm Ave. What kinds of connections do you make?  </p>
	
	<p> My goal was to visualize what it's like to navigate with no sense of direction. When I bike through Boston, I move between familiar points with little awareness of how they fit on a map. </p>
	<p>The spoke-like words represent possible thoughts. The concentric circles describe geographical features along the way. Moving outward leads to BU, but the path reveals much more about your mind than it does about your physical location in the city. </p>

<p> Below is an earlier draft specific to my own thought patterns. (Colors mark the origins of thoughts.) </p>

<p> purple = randomly generated </p>
<p> green = generated by my environment </p>
<p> light blue = related by sound </p>
<p> turquoise = related by meaning </p>
